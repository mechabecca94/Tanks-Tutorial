THE GAMES
======
TANKS: THE UNTOLD STORIES is a collection of game modifications made to Unity’s default TANKS! tutorial. By remixing and rewriting an archetype of the shooter genre, each chapter reflectively interrogates the relationship between “Tank” as play character and “tank” as cultural/societal/moral symbol. Further, as part of the course CART 415 with Pippin Barr, the works each address a formal game design element in their presentation; respectively highlighting lights & camera, music & sounds, and 3D objects as aesthetic experimentation elements. 

<i><b>Chapter 1: Backstory </i>asks: What motivates a Tank?</b>  
<i>The idea for this project came from thinking about how empty the original tanks tutorial felt - which didn't seem so much a problem with that game, but rather its role within the shooting genre itself. I found myself asking; who are these tanks? Why are they shooting each other? In what would be a remake of the original prototype I submitted for class, this final version became a corny, cheesy, Western-esque approach to character development that substituted one empty backstory for another. </i>

<i><b>Chapter 2: Meaning</i> asks: Can a Tank create rather than destroy?</b>  
<i>As the subtitle suggests, the idea for this game came from thinking about "tank" as a being in this gameworld and in our real world; are tanks doomed to be violent? Could a tank ever make something beautiful? The two player gameplay of the original, which was intended to be competitive through design, is here intended - but ultimately "fails" due to the clunkiness of the dancers - to be something more romantic. In a sort of TANKS! of Theseus, the player is left wondering wherein the violence of a tank lies. </i>

<i><b>Chapter 3: Audience</i> asks: What does playing with Tanks mean?</b>  
<i>The last of my projects but among the first of my inspirations, I created this work while reflecting on violence in media, games, and culture  with particular concern for its relationship to children. The cutesy art style of the original game combined with these troubles left me wondering what it would be like to take the original's third person perspective and give its "viewer" an identity. Now, I am asking the player to both embody a child and someone more like a parent as their understanding of war as subtext is challenged. </i>

THE PROCESS
======
As part of my course work and attempts to be a more reflective designer, I kept fairly hefty project logs and documentation throughout the duration of this project. These are kept on the same Git repo for the Tanks stories project, often along with comments for individual commits. The hopes of this approach is one that Pippin first advocated, and one that is attended to allow anyone to see the development of the project throughout its entirety.

THE DEV
======

Rebecca Goodine is a Master of Design student at Concordia University who is interested in using game design for the purposes of eliciting reflection. She has previously been involved in various art and educational game design projects, from the serious to the silly and quite a few things in between. Links to these projects as well as her game design writing can be found on her website [here](https://rebeccagoodine.com/games-studies/) and [here](https://rebeccagoodine.com/games/).
