TANKS: THE UNTOLD STORIES is a collection of game modifications made to Unity’s default TANKS! tutorial. By remixing and rewriting an archetype of the shooter genre, each chapter reflectively interrogates the relationship between “Tank” as play character and “tank” as cultural/societal/moral symbol. Further, the works each address a formal game design element in their presentation, respectively highlighting lights & camera, music & sounds, and 3D objects as aesthetic experimentation elements. 

Chapter 1: Backstory asks: What motivates a Tank? 
Chapter 2: Meaning asks: Can a Tank create rather than destroy? 
Chapter 3: Audience asks: What does playing with Tanks mean?
