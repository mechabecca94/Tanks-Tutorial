While listening to Pippin’s presentation today I tried to record some of the immediate ideas that came to me. 

- Ultra gritty war version of tanks, Paths of Tanks.
- A game where the tanks are UFOS and the ground is the night sky (exercise in lighting)
- Film Noir tanks murder mystery
- Split screen tanks where one tank rolls up to the point on other screen and shoots the other for dramatic effect, use of jump cut?
- Split screen where one focuses on graveyard, other focuses on tanks like semi-normal gameplay? Camera for some reason strikes me as being more difficult to master effectively, but to perhaps be less fundamentally core to altering gameplay.
- Shooting jumpcuts between current gameplay and graveyard for both players
- Sticky lights, the light from the bullet stays to where it hits?
- Tank in an elevator. Inspired by Concorcia's congestion. Maybe somehow use motion and industrialization as a statement about war industry.
- Tanks in a sandbox, child’s arm reaches in to pick them up?

I’ve been thinking a lot about death and the triviality of such in games recently, particularly when it comes to the subject of “emotional” and “empathy” games; how these works often feel different because they feel things a game normally wouldn’t. That Dragon Cancer was one example where the whole point is in dealing with a single death, vs. the mindless slaughter of TANKS! 

I don’t know how far I want to go with the “serious” part of it - as has been the case with the Reflective work I’ve been doing with Rilla, sometimes humor can be just as effective in creating moments for reconsideration of a situation.

All eight tutorials are now done. Some initial thoughts before sitting down to experiment with the lighting assignment:

- Using the color editing tool on the background elements was the most interesting graphic abilitiy explored so far to me. I particularly think expermienting with "washing out" certain elements of the scenery could be neat. Increpare has done some [cool stuff](https://www.increpare.com/2013/01/letter-to-my-first-born-son/) with that aesthetic.
- The tutorial's audio mixing made the engine too quiet imo... let that puppy roar.
- Better ambient audio overall will be a big thing, see Desertwindscape.mp4
- Don't like that the tank hurts itself
- I make too many Git commits

Uploaded my in-progress tutorial file to GitHub, which is 1/2 done or 1/2 not done depending on your life outlook.
