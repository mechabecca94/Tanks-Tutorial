# Tanks Tutorial Log

## January 11 2018 ##
All eight tutorials are now done. Some initial thoughts before sitting down to experiment with the lighting assignment:

- Using the color editing tool was the most interesting graphic abilitiy explored so far to me. Expermienting with "washing out" certain elements at play could be near. Increpare has done some [cool stuff](https://www.increpare.com/2013/01/letter-to-my-first-born-son/) work with that aesthetic.
- The tutorial's audio mixing made the engine too quiet imo... let that puppy roar.
- Better ambient audio will be a big thing, see Desertwindscape.mp4
- Don't like that the tank hurts itself
- I make too many Git commits
