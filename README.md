# Lights & Camera #

## February 5 2018 ##
It was good to hear in today’s feedback session that people resonated with the thematic approach I’d taken to the game. Particularly the simple title on the main floor/screen as a kind of one word logline seemed to interest people (which is great, given what a mess it was to get the shaders to work with that!). Some helpful suggestions were also provided on how I could refine the message when taking the project forward. One useful idea was to expand the narrative of the tanks fighting each other. <i>Does the tone of the onscreen thoughts change as the battle wages on? Do the jump cuts fade as the tanks’ health diminishes, or do they become more clear as their aggression rises?</i> There was also a noted tension between playability and frustration for the sake of thematic illustration, something that I do want to revisit when we go about polishing our final projects for distribution. I also wish I’d maybe spent a bit more time on was the lights element; although I tried to make killing the other player more impactful by also turning off the main lighting source, it was a subtlety that largely got missed in playtesting.

Personally I am happy that I’ve gotten quite a bit more comfortable with navigating the Unity engine, as technical capabilities were (for better or worse) something that admittedly shaped this first round’s design. I’m also glad that in the project I was able to get a singular tonal direction by the end of things... It is bleak. (Having recently lost a close family member to what was likely combat related PTSD, the “real” disambiguation of "tanks" was at the forefront of my mind while making this work).

I do though think I’d like to try be a bit more humorously playful in my next design. It is a fine line to walk between the absurd (*the eyeballs, cough cough*) and the humorous. It’s an even trickier line to walk when it comes to making satire, versus dark humor, versus risking being too pretentious. Going forward with sound, I think it’ll be a valuable writing, game design, and story exercise to see how I can look beyond the TANKS! base game and start to mould my own creative direction.

So, definitely doing karaoke tanks...?

As I've been documenting in the individual pushes, I have been really stuck on bouncing back and forth on how I want to use the split screen and destroying light elements. The two most complete scenes in the working "Permadeath" branch (messy structure - sorry Pippin!) are a) one that has a pair of eyes following the player, and b) one that "jumpcuts" to two half scenes that, when both players are trying to shoot each other, combine into one single message. 
The eye idea (a) on its own was going to be a bit silly and divergent from the original EYE FOR AN EYE message. The split screen version (b) was too boring.

Today, I am bringing it back and stopping myself from working on two project files(!) anymore with these assertions;

1. Switching cameras is how I want to convey power and omniscience, direction vs. directionless. An above view of the tanks makes the conflict feel small and trivial; a cut to something level is grounded.
2. Losing the world light comes from killing the other player.
3. The promised reward, and difference between the two players, is arbitrary.

So - linking it back to the original split screen prototype idea where pressing space shows a different scene - this is how I try to convey the theme of AN EYE FOR AN EYE MAKES THE WHOLE WORLD BLIND.

1. Shooting blocks the other player's identity from view with a promised reward.
2. Following orders to kill the other leaves ultimately one alone and in the dark.

Seeing the other students' work is quite incredible and inspiring. It's good to know that I'm on to something resonant with the splitting camera and vanishing light, but one thing that struck me is that I don't have a gameplay look clearly outlined. I was intentionally experimenting with permadeath, but for next week I'd like to aim to get a play loop, even if it's just as simple as a restart button after killing the other player. Playing more properly with aesthetics (visual and audio) are also on my watch list. In making the prototypes I stripped almost everything out of the game, and now I want to see what I think warrants going back in.

Yesterday while finding examples for the references pages for the CART course, I found myself really being drawn to a lot of (film) examples that were more interesting for their use of camera as opposed to lighting. When I sat down this morning to try and make a more heavily focused excercise in lighting anyway (Film noir/ "Paths of Tanks"), I didn't really enjoy the (broken) end result. I think maybe I'll hold that idea for later in the course and focus on the split screen version.

...As promised, in the evening I dug back into the "YOU KILLED ME" approach and really started to run with it. In trying to make this a work that is both a lighting/camera excercise and "reflect-y" experiment for my research group work, I've chosen shooting and all the messy implications of that action as my main design focal point. This started in the YOU KILLED ME excercise where I had assigned a simple screen split function to pop up when the player(s) pushed space or enter to shoot, dually obscuring half of the screen that would help with aim and throwing an unpleasant message into their field of view. I've done something similar in this most recent build, and although I'm definitely not set on how it is, I think adjusting overall visual and environmental elements has made some nice dramatic touches to the new AN EYE FOR AN EYE approach. 

It came while thinking about something I'd noticed in the previous class, about the tanks hurting themselves when they shoot. In terms of game design it wasn't something I would necessarily have chosen, but on the theme of violence, it was an interesting (poignant) thing to work with.

This theme is something that I definitely want to keep working on conveying... perhaps completely without text...?

While listening to Pippin’s presentation today I tried to record some of the immediate ideas that came to me:

- ~~An ultra gritty war version of tanks, Paths of Tanks.~~
- ~~A game where the tanks are UFOS and the ground is the night sky (exercise in lighting)~~
- ~~Film Noir tanks murder mystery~~
- Split screen tanks where one tank rolls up to the point on the other's screen half and shoots for dramatic effect.
- Split screen where one focuses on graveyard, other focuses on tanks like semi-normal gameplay? Camera for some reason strikes me as being more difficult to master effectively, but to perhaps be less fundamentally core to altering gameplay.
- Using the spacebar/shooting to create a jumpcut between current gameplay and a graveyard, two version of mourners for both players
- ~~Sticky lights, the light from the bullet stays to where it hits?~~
- ~~Tank in an elevator. Inspired by Concorcia's congestion. Maybe somehow use motion and industrialization as a statement about war industry.~~
- ~~Tanks in a sandbox, child’s arm reaches in to pick them up?~~

I’ve been thinking a lot about death and the triviality of such in games recently, particularly when it comes to the subject of “emotional” and “empathy” games. It's interesting how these works are different because they make the player feel things a game normally wouldn’t, even if these feelings are generally a part of offline life. That Dragon Cancer is one (great) example where the whole point is in dealing with a single death, vs. the mindless slaughter of TANKS! 

Despite how serious some of these ideas sound, I don’t know how far I want to go with the downer part of this. As has been the case with the Reflective work I’ve been doing with Rilla, sometimes humor can be just as effective in creating moments for reconsideration of a situation. Generally I think the themes that jump out to me from this brainstorming are the notions of children's games, war as meaningless conflict, and war as industry.

All eight tutorials are now done. Some initial thoughts before sitting down to experiment with the lighting assignment:

- Using the color editing tool on the background elements was the most interesting graphic abilitiy explored so far to me. I particularly think expermienting with "washing out" certain elements of the scenery could be neat. Increpare has done some [cool stuff](https://www.increpare.com/2013/01/letter-to-my-first-born-son/) with that aesthetic.
- The tutorial's audio mixing made the engine too quiet imo... let that puppy roar.
- Better ambient audio overall will be a big thing, see Desertwindscape.mp4
- Don't like that the tank hurts itself
- I make too many Git commits

Uploaded my in-progress tutorial file to GitHub, which is 1/2 done or 1/2 not done depending on your life outlook.

In the beginning there was GitHub.
