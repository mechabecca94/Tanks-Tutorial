Yesterday while finding examples for the references pages for the CART course, I found myself really being drawn to a lot of (film) examples that used camera as opposed to lighting. When I sat down today to try and make a more heavily focused excercise in lighting ("Paths of Tanks"), I didn't really enjoy the (broken) end result. It could definitely be a cool version, but I think maybe I'll hold that idea for later in the course and focus on the split screen version.

While listening to Pippin’s presentation today I tried to record some of the immediate ideas that came to me:

- ~~An ultra gritty war version of tanks, Paths of Tanks.~~
- ~~A game where the tanks are UFOS and the ground is the night sky (exercise in lighting)~~
- ~~Film Noir tanks murder mystery~~
- Split screen tanks where one tank rolls up to the point on the other's screen half and shoots for dramatic effect.
- Split screen where one focuses on graveyard, other focuses on tanks like semi-normal gameplay? Camera for some reason strikes me as being more difficult to master effectively, but to perhaps be less fundamentally core to altering gameplay.
- Using the spacebar/shooting to create a jumpcut between current gameplay and a graveyard, two version of mourners for both players
- ~~Sticky lights, the light from the bullet stays to where it hits?~~
- ~~Tank in an elevator. Inspired by Concorcia's congestion. Maybe somehow use motion and industrialization as a statement about war industry.~~
- ~~Tanks in a sandbox, child’s arm reaches in to pick them up?~~

I’ve been thinking a lot about death and the triviality of such in games recently, particularly when it comes to the subject of “emotional” and “empathy” games. It's interesting how these works are different because they make the player feel things a game normally wouldn’t, even if these feelings are generally a part of offline life. That Dragon Cancer is one (great) example where the whole point is in dealing with a single death, vs. the mindless slaughter of TANKS! 

Despite how serious some of these ideas sound, I don’t know how far I want to go with the downer part of this. As has been the case with the Reflective work I’ve been doing with Rilla, sometimes humor can be just as effective in creating moments for reconsideration of a situation. Generally I think the themes that jump out to me from this brainstorming are the notions of children's games, war as meaningless conflict, and war as industry.

All eight tutorials are now done. Some initial thoughts before sitting down to experiment with the lighting assignment:

- Using the color editing tool on the background elements was the most interesting graphic abilitiy explored so far to me. I particularly think expermienting with "washing out" certain elements of the scenery could be neat. Increpare has done some [cool stuff](https://www.increpare.com/2013/01/letter-to-my-first-born-son/) with that aesthetic.
- The tutorial's audio mixing made the engine too quiet imo... let that puppy roar.
- Better ambient audio overall will be a big thing, see Desertwindscape.mp4
- Don't like that the tank hurts itself
- I make too many Git commits

Uploaded my in-progress tutorial file to GitHub, which is 1/2 done or 1/2 not done depending on your life outlook.
